## Disease Transmission Dynamics

The model simulates disease transmission using a **modified SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) framework**:

### Disease States

Each patient has an associated `PersonDisease` object that tracks:

- **Susceptible**: Patient is not colonized
- **Colonized**: Patient is asymptomatic carrier of the disease
- **Clinically Infected**: Patient shows symptoms (detected or not)

### State Transitions

```
Susceptible
    ↓ (transmission event)
Colonized
    ├→ Detected By Surveillance
    ├→ Clinically Detected
    └→ Decolonized (natural clearance)
  ↓
Susceptible
```

## Disease Importation

### Admission-Based Importation

When a new patient is admitted:

1. **Importation probability** (`importationRate`, default: 0.206) determines if they arrive colonized
2. If colonized, they immediately enter the **Colonized** state
3. They begin shedding and can transmit to other patients

### Configuration

```xml
<parameter name="importationRate" value="0.206"/>
<!-- Probability (0-1) that new admits arrive colonized -->
```

## Transmission

### Beta-Based Transmission
::: {.callout-note}
**TODO:  Find a link to the mathematical explanation of this.**
:::
Disease transmission within the facility follows a **contact transmission model**:

- **Beta coefficient** (`beta`, default: 0.0615)
  - Probability of transmission per unit time between colonized and susceptible patient
  - Accounts for contact rates, pathogen viability, and inoculum size

- **Transmission rate** is updated when:
  - Patient is admitted
  - Patient is discharged
  - Isolation status changes
  - Surveillance testing changes

### Isolation Effectiveness

When a patient is isolated:

- **Isolation effectiveness** (`isolationEffectiveness`, default: 0.5)
  - Multiplier applied to beta when patient is isolated
  - 0.5 = 50% reduction in transmission probability
  - Represents practice like hand hygiene, PPE, contact precautions

## Surveillance & Detection

### Active Surveillance Testing

#### Admission Surveillance
- **Triggered**: When patient admitted (if `onActiveSurveillance = true`)
- **Probability**: `probSurveillanceDetection` per disease
- **Adherence**: `admissionSurveillanceAdherence` (default: 0.911)
- **Outcome**: If positive, patient is isolated

#### Periodic Surveillance
- **Interval**: `daysBetweenMidstaySurveillanceTests` (default: 14 days)
- **Adherence**: `midstaySurveillanceAdherence` (default: 0.954)
- **Scheduling**: Starts when patient is admitted

### Clinical Detection

- **Natural detection**: Colonized patients may develop symptoms and be detected
- **Detection rate**: Exponentially-distributed with mean `avgTimeToClinicDetection`
- **Isolation**: Clinically detected patients are immediately isolated

## Decolonization

### Spontaneous Clearance

- **Duration**: Exponentially-distributed with mean `avgDecolonizationTime` (default: 387 days)
- **Outcome**: Patient transitions from Colonized → Susceptible
- **No intervention**: Does not require treatment in the baseline model

## Population Dynamics

### Patient Flow

1. **Admission**
   - Continuous process with rate `newPatientAdmissionRate`
   - Length of stay (LOS) sampled from facility-specific distribution

2. **Length of Stay**
   - Type 0 (LTAC): Mixture of two gamma distributions
     - 62.5% probability: Gamma(shape=7.6, scale=3.4) days
     - 37.5% probability: Gamma(shape=1.2, scale=23.5) days

3. **Discharge**
   - Patient is removed when LOS expires
   - Transmission contribution is updated
   - Patient statistics (patient-days) are recorded

## Simulation Timeline

### Burn-In Period (10 years)

- Allows system to reach equilibrium
- No statistics collected
- No patient tracking
- Sets up realistic initial conditions

### Measurement Period (5 years)

- All statistics are collected
- Event logs are recorded
- Output files are generated

### Key Time Representations

- **1.0 tick** = 1 day
- **1.5 tick** = midday (0.5 × 24 hours into the day)
- **Total duration** = 5475 ticks = 15 years (10 burn-in + 5 measurement)

## Facility Types

Currently supports one facility type:

### Type 0: Long-Term Acute Care (LTAC)

- High prevalence of comorbidities
- Longer stays than acute care
- Higher disease transmission risk
- Default for FacilityEpiSim model

## Output Statistics

### Summary Statistics
- Total admissions and patient-days
- Prevalence of colonization
- Incidence of disease
- Detection rates
- Transmission events

### Time Series Data
- Daily population size
- Daily prevalence
- Daily incidence
- Cumulative outcomes

### Event Logs
- Each admission with importation status
- Each transmission event
- Each clinical/surveillance detection
- Each decolonization event

## Key Assumptions

1. **Homogeneous mixing**: All patients have equal contact probability (modified by isolation)
2. **Independent diseases**: Multiple diseases tracked independently
3. **Perfect detection**: Detected patients are immediately and perfectly isolated
4. **No treatment**: Decolonization only through natural clearance
5. **No reinfection**: Once decolonized, patients are not immediately re-infected
6. **Exponential distributions**: Natural processes follow exponential distributions

## Model Limitations

- Single facility (no multi-facility transmission)
- No spatial structure (everyone can contact everyone)
- No seasonality effects
- No staff agents (only patient populations)
- Simplified detection and isolation mechanics
- No cost/economic considerations
