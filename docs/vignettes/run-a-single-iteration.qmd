title: "Run a Single Iteration of the Model"
---

## Prerequisites
- a functioning installation of Repast Simphony
- a project in Repast that is a clone of the facilityepisim project

## Run the model one time
Single runs of the model are useful primarily for verifying that the 
model is built correctly and that the distribution of various outputs
conforms to expectations.  


### Step by step

1. Find the green triangle run button.

2. Pull down the drop-down menu and click single-facility model.
