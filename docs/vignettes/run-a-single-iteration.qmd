title: "Run a Single Iteration of the Model"
---

## Prerequisites
- a functioning installation of Repast Simphony
- a project in Repast that is a clone of the facilityepisim project

## Run the model one time
Single runs of the model are useful primarily for verifying that the 
model is built correctly and that the distribution of various outputs
conforms to expectations.  


### Step by step

1. Find the green triangle run button.

2. Pull down the drop-down menu and click FacilityEpiSim model.

3. Wait an indeterminate amount of time (up to 2 minutes).

4. You will see the Repast Simphony single-run interface.

5. To change the parameters for this run, find the Parameters tab at the bottom of the frame on the left.

6. Update parameters as necessary.

7. When the parameters are configured the way you want them, find the blue **Initialize Run** button on the toolbar.  Click it, wait for the simulation to initialize, the press the **start** button right next to it.

8. You'll see the **Tick Count** in the upper right begin to increase.  The simulation is running!
9. When it reaches the end, close the window and look in the root folder of the project for new .txt files containing the results.
