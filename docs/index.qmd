## Overview

This is an **agent-based model (ABM)** built with **Repast Simphony 2.11.0** for simulating disease transmission in healthcare facilities.

The model simulates patient flow through a inpatient over approximately **15 years** (10-year burn-in + 5-year measurement period), tracking:

- Patient admissions, lengths of stay, and discharges
- Disease importation and transmission dynamics
- Clinical detection and active surveillance testing
- Decolonization outcomes and isolation effectiveness


## Key Features

### Model Dynamics
- **Modified SIS Model**: Susceptible → Infected/Colonized → Susceptible transmission dynamics
- **Importation**: Probability-based disease introduction via new patient admissions
- **Transmission**: Beta coefficient-based contact transmission between patients
- **Surveillance**: Active surveillance testing with configurable adherence rates
- **Isolation**: Transmission reduction for detected/isolated patients

### Output & Analysis

- CSV outputs for time series analysis in single-run mode
- Event logs for admissions, transmissions, detections, etc.
- Batch running capabilities for parameter sweeps
- R scripts for verifying model behaviors and sensitivity analyses

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Install Requirements**: Java 11 + Repast Simphony 2.11.0
2. **Clone Repository**: Get the source code
3. **Configure Parameters**: Via the Repast Model Runner
4. **Run Simulation**: Via the Repast Model Runner
5. **Analyze Results**: Use R scripts in `analysis/`

## Vignettes & Examples

Explore the model through practical examples:

- **[Basic Simulation](vignettes/01-basic-simulation.qmd)** - Run your first simulation and interpret outputs
- **[Surveillance Strategies](vignettes/02-surveillance-comparison.qmd)** - Compare different surveillance approaches
- **[Parameter Sensitivity](vignettes/03-parameter-sensitivity.qmd)** - Analyze model sensitivity to key parameters

## Time Representation

**NOTE**: Time in this model is continuous floating-point in **days**:
- `1.0` = Start of day 1
- `1.5` = Middle of day 1
- Default total: **5475 ticks** = 15 years with or without a 10-year burn-in
