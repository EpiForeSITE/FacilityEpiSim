# FacilityEpiSim - Disease Transmission Model

A Java-based agent-based model (ABM) built with Repast Simphony for simulating disease transmission in healthcare facilities, with a focus on Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and other healthcare-associated infections.

## Overview

This simulation model represents a single healthcare facility where patients are admitted, may become colonized with a disease, can transmit the disease to other patients, and may be clinically detected and isolated. The model is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of different surveillance and intervention strategies in controlling healthcare-associated infections.
